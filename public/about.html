<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi there! ðŸ‘‹</p>

  <p>Iâ€™m currently on a journey to become a full-stack web developer â€” and itâ€™s one Iâ€™m truly passionate about.</p>

<p>I come from a background as a computer operator and IT support, but Iâ€™ve always wanted more â€” more growth, more creativity, and more opportunity. 
  Thatâ€™s what led me to start learning programming. One reason is practical: Iâ€™m working toward a career change that offers better earning potential and long-term stability.
  But beyond that, I have a real vision â€” a web app idea that Iâ€™d love to bring to life and see people actually using.</p>

<p>Right now, Iâ€™m building a strong foundation through Dr. Angela Yuâ€™s Web Development Bootcamp, learning HTML, CSS, and soon diving into JavaScript, Node, React, and backend technologies.
   My goal is to eventually specialize in backend development, where I believe I can really flourish.</p>

<p>This portfolio showcases the first steps of my journey â€” basic but meaningful projects that mark the beginning of something much bigger. 
  I'm excited to keep learning, building, and turning ideas into reality.

  Thanks for checking out my work!.</p>
